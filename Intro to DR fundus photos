Diabetic retinopathy, DR, is the leading cause of visual loss in the working populaition age group. 
Because of the Covid pandemic as well as numerous personal issues many patients have had lapses
in their diabetic monitoring, care and follow up. While these problems are not really a valid
excuse for inadequate medical care, having a possible shortcut to get back into the proper path
for at least emergent need medical care might be useful. Thus if a screening retinal fundus photo showed certain
higher risk changes, that would alert these individuals with less economic means or indolence or lack
of inclination of the need to rapidly get glucose monitoring, 
see their internist and retinologist and get back on track with their diabetic regimen.
It is with this in mind that I thought to use fundus photo models for different stages of DR to create an algorithm from
serial patient fundus photos to inform on the pattern of incremental risk for visual loss.
